Here I will explain my code in R for seventh assignment.

Task 1: We've already imported dplyr and tidyr libraries and then we are changing our data frame iris
to iris_long using pivot_longer(as it was showed on the exercises on the 4.12).

Task 2.1: Mean length and width of sepals and petals per species. We use group_by to group by Species
and Trait. Next we are computing mean on the size column. Also, I've read, that we can use .groups = "drop"
after summarise(), to remove grouping after aggregation. After summarise, on default we drop grouping by
Trait(second parameter), and we use .group = "drop", to drop also Species after aggregation.

Task 2.2: Largest + widest(max) sepal & petal for virginica and versicolor.
To do it, we are filtering by Species and of course picking only virginica and versicolor,
next we are grouping them by Spieces and Trait and summarising, searching the largest size.
At the end, as I already explained earlier, we drop our column Species(inspite of Trait, which was
droppped earlier)

Task 2.3: For each species & trait: how many observations are above the mean
So, in the first step(before creating above_mean) we are computing mean per species and trait.
Also, nothing special, just computing grouping by Species and Trait and then summarising.
In the second step, we are joining back and count observations, that are greater than mean.
Then, we also group by Species and Trait and summarise at the end.
