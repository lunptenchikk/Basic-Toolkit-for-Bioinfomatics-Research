## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
set.seed(123)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
countries <- c("USA", "France", "Italy", "Spain", "UK")

covid_data <- expand_grid(
date = seq.Date(as.Date("2020-03-01"), by = "day", length.out = 60),
country = countries
) %>%
mutate(
deaths = round(
case_when(
country == "USA" ~ rnorm(n(), 800, 150),
country == "Italy" ~ rnorm(n(), 600, 120),
country == "Spain" ~ rnorm(n(), 500, 100),
country == "France" ~ rnorm(n(), 400, 80),
country == "UK" ~ rnorm(n(), 450, 90)
)
)
)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
median_lines <- covid_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(median_deaths = median(deaths), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(covid_data, aes(x = date, y = deaths)) +
  geom_line(
    color = "steelblue",
    alpha = 0.6,
    linewidth = 0.9
  )+ geom_hline(
    data = median_lines,
    aes(yintercept = median_deaths),
    color = "darkred",
    linewidth = 0.8,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) + facet_wrap(~ country, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Daily COVID-19 Deaths by Country",
    subtitle = "Dashed line = median deaths per country",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Deaths per day"
  ) + theme_minimal(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )




```

```{r}
print("Thank you for this course!")
```
